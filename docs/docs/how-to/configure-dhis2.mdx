:::info
The Instant OpenHIE architecture, codebase, and documentation are under active development and are subject to change. While we encourage adoption and extension of the Instant OpenHIE framework, we do not consider this ready for production use at this stage.
:::

We have implemented **District Health Information System v2** (DHIS2) as the Health Management Information System (HMIS) in the Instant OpenHIE.
DHIS2 was chosen due to its high level of community support and usage. It is possible to implement a different HMIS software in place of DHIS2.

The default Instant OpenHIE DHIS2 instance is completely blank and can be setup locally using `Docker-Compose` or setup in the cloud using `Kubernetes`.

To automate configuring DHIS2 for your use case, you will need to create a custom Instant OpenHIE package.
The [WHO Covid19 Surveillance Package](https://github.com/jembi/who-covid19-surveillance-package) is an example of this kind of custom HMIS configuration.

Below, we cover how you would go about configuring DHIS2 for your use case.
