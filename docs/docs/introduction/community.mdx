:::info
The Instant OpenHIE architecture, codebase, and documentation are under active development and are subject to change. While we encourage adoption and extension of the Instant OpenHIE framework, we do not consider this ready for production use at this stage.
:::

Instant OpenHIE is an open-source project, developed by [Jembi Health Systems](https://www.jembi.org/) and [IntraHealth International](https://www.intrahealth.org/).

We encourage any contributions and suggestions! If you would like to get involved, please visit us on [Github](https://github.com/openhie/instant). Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/openhie/instant/issues/new) or to [create a PR](https://github.com/openhie/instant/compare) to see your features included in the project.

Instant OpenHIE is extensible by design. Consider [creating a package](../how-to/creating-packages.mdx) to support your particular use case.

We look forward to growing the set of capabilities within Instant OpenHIE together!
