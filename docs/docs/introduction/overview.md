The Instant OpenHIE project aims to reduce the costs and skills required for software developers to deploy an OpenHIE architecture for quicker initial solution testing and as a starting point for faster production implementation and customization. Instant OpenHIE will be a simple way for technical persons to install and see a complex system working against a real-world use case. It will allow technical persons to illustrate how interoperability can work to solve health challenges and show how a national interoperability architecture could be created with open-source software and standards.
