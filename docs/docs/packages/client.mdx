## Package functionality

This package sets up [OpenCR](https://www.openclientregistry.org) which acts as a client registry. Other solutions may be added in future to function as client registries.

OpenCR provides a unique identifier for patients (clients) that links to all other already matched records from all submitting systems. Please see the [documentation](https://intrahealth.github.io/client-registry/user/introduction/) for more about client registries and OpenCR.

## Deployment strategy
