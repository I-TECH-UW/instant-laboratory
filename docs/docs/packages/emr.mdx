:::info
The Instant OpenHIE architecture, codebase, and documentation are under active development and are subject to change. While we encourage adoption and extension of the Instant OpenHIE framework, we do not consider this ready for production use at this stage.

### Electronic Medical Record Package
The Instant OpenHIE EMR package installs and starts up an instance of OpenMRS - a Medical Record System. 
This installation option simplifies the OpenMRS manual system installation and makes it a consistent deployment experience across multiple operating systems to quickly deploy the OpenMRS system on a pc/laptop for demonstration and assessment purposes.
This means that the implementer does not have to install multiple dependencies manually (mysql db, web servers, config etc) but instead have a functional application running instantly.

The OpenMRS includes some of the following facility-level patient administration features:

- Patient record management
  - Patient registration
  - Find Patient Record
  - Merge Patient electronic record
  - Diagnoses
  - Vitals
  - Visits
  - Allergies
- Appointment scheduling
- Reports
- Dispense medication
