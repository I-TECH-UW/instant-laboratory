## Package functionality

This package sets up the [Global Open Facility Registry - GOFR](https://www.facilitymatch.net) which acts as a facility registry. Other solutions may be added in future to function as facility registries.

GOFR provides the ability to manage an authoritative facility list and reconcile lists of other systems. Please see the [documentation](https://www.facilitymatch.net/documentation) for more about facility registries.

## Deployment strategy
