## Package functionality

This package sets up the [iHRIS](https://www.ihris.org) health workforce solutions suite as a health worker registry. Other solutions may be added in future to function as health worker registries.

iHRIS provides the ability to manage health workers. Please see the [technical documentation](https://ihris.github.io/iHRIS/) for more about customizing and deploying iHRIS or the [website](https://www.ihris.org) for more information.

## Deployment strategy
