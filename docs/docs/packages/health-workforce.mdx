## Package functionality

This package sets up the iHRIS and GOFR applications which act as a Provider and Facility registry respectively.
They are able to be queried for facility and practitioner information using the mCSD IHE profile.

It also sets up a mediator that synchronises (using mCSD) practitioner and facility data with the central FHIR store that is provided by the core package.
This allows the user of the HIE to query this interlinked data from a single location.
The end goal is to enable answering questions such as the one in the following scenario:

_A doctor, Joseph, at a rural clinic wants to refer a patient, Mousa, to an Oncologist because of a lump that they suspect may be cancerous.
They are able to look up a list of specialists that offer that service in their EMR system.
They choose a particular specialist and find out the facilities in which they work.
A referral can now be produced by the EMR for the patient and they can be sent to that facility for their visit._

**PractitionerRole -> Practitioner -> Facility**

This package aims to enable [this OpenHIE workflow](https://wiki.ohie.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22053221) using the newer mCSD IHE profile.

## Deployment strategy
