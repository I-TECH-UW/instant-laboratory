## Covid19-Immunization
This Instant OpenHIE package is available to demonstrate  the implementation for covid-19 immunization tracking work-flows. This package caters for the following work-flows:
- Patient registration
- Immunization

The goal is to allow for the collection of data from different data sources, by using an industry standard for the health information exchange. Patient identities are uniquely maintained by making use of a client registry that matches patient records based on demographic characteristics.

The Covid19 Immunization Tracking Package is available at the following location: https://github.com/jembi/covid19-immunization-tracking-package

This package is dependant on the following infrastructural packages:
- Client
- Core
