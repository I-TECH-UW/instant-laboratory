The Instant OpenHIE architecture, codebase, and documentation are under active development and are subject to change. While we encourage adoption and extension of the Instant OpenHIE framework, we do not consider this ready for production use at this stage.

The following section provides an overview regarding the available use case packages as well as their infrastructural requirements.

There are currently three custom packages available:
